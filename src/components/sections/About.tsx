          My name's Cameron Tredoux and I've lived all around the world &mdash;
          from South Africa to Romania to the United States.

          I began coding in 2012 and have since turned it into my life's
          passion. I spend most of my time rock climbing, attending class, and
          learning new things &mdash; recently, I've enjoyed learning about
          mentorships and business networking.
        </p>
        This portfolio was a passion project and learning process; it introduced
        me to new React libraries and brought out my creativity, and I hope that
        it &mdash; and my other projects &mdash; showcase my skills.
